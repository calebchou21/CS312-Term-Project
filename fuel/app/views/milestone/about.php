            <h2>Clay Kleespies</h2>
            <p>I am a senior majoring in computer science and minoring in business. I plan on using my education to persue a career at NASA. I want to go to space and use my computer science knowledge to advance space exploration. I am enrolled in the honors option at Colorado State University. I am graduating from college in three years. I have a black belt in Muay Thai.

            <p>
                 I am a second year computer science student here at Colorado State. I'm originally from Portland, Oregon but moved here for school.
                 In my spare time I love to go outdoors and rock climb or hike. I also love to read, play the drums, and watch movies.
                 Currently I am enrolled in the general computer science concentration but would like 
                 to explore all the options that the field has to offer. A fun fact about me is that I have 
                 traveled all around the world to rock climb.

            <p>Hello! I am a 2nd year computer science major at Colorado State University. 
                I am a general concentration comp sci major, who is still figuring out exactly
                what I want to do within the field. Outside of school, I spend my time with friends,
                rock climbing, running, playing video games, watching movies, or spending time volunteering
                for a program called Young Life. I also work part-time at Starbucks. A fun fact about me is
                that I have signed up for the show Survivor two times and will sign up until I get on the show!
