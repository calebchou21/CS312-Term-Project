        Aftersun is a movie about a young woman looking back at a holiday she shared with her father as a young girl. 
        Her father appears to be out of the picture at this point in her life, and she recounts this last memory
        of her father with nostalgia. Though it is not said, it is implied that her father has committed suicide as
        we are shown multiple instances of her father dealing with what seems to be depression or anxiety.

        This is a movie that I saw recently that I instantly fell in love with. It is the epitome of show, don't tell. Though we are given 
        details, the viewer always gets enough information to piece together what is happening. The fact that we are seeing this time
        this daughter and father spent together through the eys of a child brings so much more to the story. Overall, this is such a quietly 
        moving film that simmers to one of the most heartbreaking and devastating ending of a movie I've ever seen.
