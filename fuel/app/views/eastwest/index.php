        Hi, in this website I will be talking about a couple of my favorite movies and the reasons
        I love them. I've loved all forms of visual media since a young age but I've always resonated
        particulary with the medium of film. Movies show us parts of the world and parts of ourselves
        that we would never see otherwise. There's something about movies that has the power to make us
        forget about our worries when the lights dim and we sit in a theater for an hour and 
        a half.

        The movies that I have choose to talk about here are Synecdoche, New York (2008) and Aftersun (2022). 
        I choose these two movies because they are both movies that have came out in the last couple decades
        that I felt left an impact on me after seeing them. These two movies are very different from each other,
        though they both were equally moving.
