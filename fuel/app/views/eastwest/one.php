        Synecdoche, New York is a 2008 film directed by Charlie Kaufman that follows the life of a theater director 
        as his commitment to realism blurs the line between fact and fiction as he dedicates years of his life to writing
        and directing a new play. The movie has elements of postmodernism and surrealism. The main character of the theater
        director is played by the late Philip Seymour Hoffman.

        One of the reasons I love this movie so much is that it is so far away from reality but the themes that we can
        draw from it are so real and true to our lives. Even though the line between real life and fiction is constantly growing
        away from reality, we never lose touch with the tangible, human tragedy in the story. I think the heavy use of symbolism
        fits the tone of the movie well without being completely overbearing, and the story as a whole just feels so grand in 
        scale. As preposterous as the story itself is, the movie ends up being very moving and tragic. I think everyone gets 
        something different out of watching this, which I think is a wonderful thing.
